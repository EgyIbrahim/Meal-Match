            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">7. PLESI Considerations</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Meal Match has been developed with careful consideration of political, legal, ethical, social, and institutional factors to ensure compliance, inclusivity, and accessibility. Below are the key considerations:</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Political</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">For development purposes, the project was hosted locally using XAMPP, ensuring full control over data storage and access. While no live deployment has occurred yet, the system has been designed with future scalability in mind and can be migrated to a cloud-based environment that operates within GDPR-compliant regions, ensuring adherence to UK and EU data protection regulations.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Legal</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The platform currently does not collect or store any personal user data, avoiding the need for GDPR measures at this stage. If a user login system is implemented in future iterations, appropriate encryption protocols and secure authentication mechanisms will be incorporated to protect sensitive data in accordance with the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Ethical</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Ethical considerations were addressed by avoiding unnecessary data collection and ensuring that all publicly accessible content is inclusive and respectful of diverse dietary and cultural needs. The website design also incorporates basic accessibility principles, such as clear contrast, readable fonts, and intuitive navigation, to support users with visual or cognitive impairments.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Social</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Meal Match has been designed to accommodate a broad range of dietary preferences and restrictions, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and allergy-sensitive diets. Language and visual design choices were made to ensure the platform remains inclusive, culturally neutral, and welcoming to a wide demographic of users from varied backgrounds.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Institutional</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Given the time and resource constraints of the academic calendar, we adopted the Agile development methodology to prioritize and deliver essential core features first. Stretch goals and additional enhancements—such as a login system and AI-generated recommendations—were scoped for potential post-submission development to ensure the final product met submission requirements without sacrificing quality.</p>
